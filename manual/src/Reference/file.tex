\hypertarget{file}{%
\section{File}\label{file}}

The \texttt{File} class provides the capability to read from and write
to files, or to obtain the contents of a file in convenient formats.

To open a file, create a File object with the filename as the argument

\begin{lstlisting}
var f = File("myfile.txt")
\end{lstlisting}

which opens \texttt{"myfile.txt"} for \emph{reading}. To open a file for
writing or appending, you need to provide a mode selector

\begin{lstlisting}
var g = File("myfile.txt", "write")
\end{lstlisting}

or

\begin{lstlisting}
var g = File("myfile.txt", "append")
\end{lstlisting}

Once the file is open, you can then read or write by calling appropriate
methods:

\begin{lstlisting}
f.lines()            // reads the contents of the file into an array of lines.
f.readline()         // reads a single line
f.readchar()         // reads a single character.
f.write(string)      // writes the arguments to the file.
\end{lstlisting}

After you're done with the file, close it with

\begin{lstlisting}
f.close()
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{lines}{%
\section{lines}\label{lines}}

Returns the contents of a file as an array of strings; each element
corresponds to a single line.

Read in the contents of a file and print line by line:

\begin{lstlisting}
var f = File("input.txt")
var s = f.lines()
for (i in s) print i
f.close()
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{readline}{%
\section{readline}\label{readline}}

Reads a single line from a file; returns the result as a string.

Read in the contents of a file and print each line:

\begin{lstlisting}
var f = File("input.txt")
while (!f.eof()) {
  print f.readline()
}
f.close()
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{readchar}{%
\section{readchar}\label{readchar}}

Reads a single character from a file; returns the result as a string.

\hypertarget{write}{%
\section{write}\label{write}}

Writes to a file.

Write the contents of a list to a file:

\begin{lstlisting}
var f = File("output.txt", "w")
for (k, i in list) f.write("${i}: ${k}")
f.close()
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{close}{%
\section{close}\label{close}}

Closes an open file.
