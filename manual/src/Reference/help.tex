\hypertarget{help}{%
\section{Help}\label{help}}

Morpho provides an online help system. To get help about a topic called
\texttt{topicname}, type

\begin{lstlisting}
help topicname
\end{lstlisting}

A list of available topics is provided below and includes language
keywords like \texttt{class}, \texttt{fn} and \texttt{for}, built in
classes like \texttt{Matrix} and \texttt{File} or information about
functions like \texttt{exp} and \texttt{random}.

Some topics have additional subtopics: to access these type

\begin{lstlisting}
help topic subtopic
\end{lstlisting}

For example, to get help on a method for a particular class, you could
type

\begin{lstlisting}
help Classname.methodname
\end{lstlisting}

Note that \texttt{help} ignores all punctuation.

You can also use \texttt{?} as a shorthand synonym for \texttt{help}

\begin{lstlisting}
? topic
\end{lstlisting}

A useful feature is that, if an error occurs, simply type \texttt{help}
to get more information about the error.

\hypertarget{quit}{%
\section{Quit}\label{quit}}

The \texttt{quit} CLI command quits \texttt{morpho} run in interactive
mode and returns to the shell.
